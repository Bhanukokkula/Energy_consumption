Energy Consumption Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting energy consumption based on various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and historical energy usage. The prediction models employ regression algorithms to estimate energy consumption, enabling better resource planning and management.

## Features
- **Data Source:** The dataset used for this project contains information about energy consumption patterns, weather data, and other relevant variables.

- **Algorithms:**
  - **Linear Regression:** A basic regression model that assumes a linear relationship between features and energy consumption.
  
  - **Decision Tree Regression:** A regression tree model that considers non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

  - **Random Forest Regression:** An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown
Copy code

## Data
- **energy_consumption_data.csv:** The dataset containing information about energy consumption, weather conditions, and other relevant variables.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
 - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and includes all necessary features.
 - Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling if required.

2. **Training:**
 - Run the `train_linear_regression.py`, `train_decision_tree_regression.py`, and `train_random_forest_regression.py` scripts to train the respective regression models on the prepared dataset.

3. **Prediction:**
 - Use the trained models to make predictions on new data by running the `predict.py` script.

## Files
- **energy_consumption_data.csv:** Sample dataset containing energy consumption and weather-related information.
- **train_linear_regression.py:** Script for training the Linear Regression model.
- **train_decision_tree_regression.py:** Script for training the Decision Tree Regression model.
- **train_random_forest_regression.py:** Script for training the Random Forest Regression model.
- **predict.py:** Script for making predictions using the trained regression models.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required for the project.

## Results
- Provide insights into the accuracy and performance of each regression model.
- Include relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error) and possibly visualizations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictions.

## Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance on both training and testing datasets.

## Future Work
- Discuss potential improvements or enhancements that can be made to the models.
- Consider experimenting with different regression algorithms, feature engineering, or incorporating additional data sources.
